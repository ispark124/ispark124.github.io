Gosh I feel like I'm forgetting how to do this again—it's been a while. Can't say I have anything particular to talk about but it feels right to just start talking about what I'm expecting for this upcoming year/semester seeing that it was the first day of classes today (and I already let **New** Years pass... lol). I also feel like I need a bit of reflection in order to really figure out what I want this upcoming year.  
  
2022 was such a **beautiful** year. It seems like a really obvious statement, but the older I get, the more depth of life I live. On top of the completely **new** experiences I got to have last year and the **new** people I got to invite into my life, there's been **new** growth over the course of the year. As I reflect on this last year, I'm reminded of a lot of what I wrote about in [success & loss](http://isaiahscorner.com/blog/success-loss/) way back when—this year has particularly been **beautiful** not just because of its mountain-top peaks but because of its low valleys.  
  
Even within the last 6 months, I've come to realize there is a massive amount change that has been both missing and needed in my life. Actually I don't even know if change is the right word, it's just time for **_new_**. It's just time for **new**. The way I see it that's also not a slight on the life I was living earlier in the year or even the past few years. I had needs that had to be met in certain ways that the past season was able to do, but now I have different needs and different desires for life that can't be met by what I had before. I'm infinitely grateful for the ways I learned to love, to give, to play, to fight, to rest, and to hurt in this past year and I wouldn't give what I did up for anything. But now it's time to relearn how to do all of those things again in a **new** way in a **new** place.  
  
Right before the start of this semester, I went on a retreat with Christian Union Nova (the campus ministry I'm involved in) and was so blessed in the time that we were gone. The Holy Spirit moved powerfully among us and reignited a desire in me that I used to be scared of. For a while I've been scared of developing a religious spirit—a lifestyle of doing "religious" things to get me into heaven. If I didn't feel like reading my bible that day or praying fervently I simply wouldn't because I didn't want to think that dragging my feet to do them were what would give Him joy. Yes, there is some truth to that—God NEVER operates out of guilt and shame. Never. And doing those things alone will not get me into heaven but it's my relationship with Him that pleases Him.  
  
But. There is a flip-side.  
  
There is a **beauty** in intentionally meeting with someone to connect with them whether you feel like it or not. There is a **beauty** in making someone a priority whether you want to meet or not. There is a **beauty** in choosing _love_ whether the feeling is there or not. I believe I'm at a point in my faith where I'm not meeting with the Lord because of anything He can do for me or what He can change in my life but simply because He is **beautiful**. Ok, I'm still working on it but I'm trying to live with the mentality that before He is useful, He is **beautiful**. Because truly, truly, truly, in Him my life is more abundant. Period.  
  
All of this to say, this is translating into a **new** way I'm living out this semester and the rest of the year. I'm not prioritizing my schedule anymore but I'm intentionally scheduling my priorities. My day isn't planning around _my_ life and squeezing in time to meet with the Lord, but it's connecting with the Lord and then scheduling my life around Him. I guess that's the way it always should have been. It's only day one but there is already so much love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control that I'm seeing in my life. Real fruit. It's incredible.  
  
There's 100% more I'm excited about this semester and so many things God's working in my life, but this is already getting long and seems like a good place to end. Looks like I'll just have to write more often, I guess. The plan is to keep doing this more regularly again but we'll see how that goes. See y'all soon.
