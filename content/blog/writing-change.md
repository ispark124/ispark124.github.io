**Writing** is hard sometimes. Right now I feel inspired to do more: I want to **write** more, I want to listen more. But if I'm being honest I have no idea what to **write** about.

I feel like there's been a trend that's been going on with my blog posts and I don't know if that's something I want to continue. I started this blog as a place for me to share my thoughts, the things I'm learning, or just creative things that come to me. But what it's turned into is a place where I feel as though I have to learn a whole life lesson. Like some children's book where I face a problem and then face some conflict-resolution and then by the end I learn how to be a better person. It's exhausting. Don't get me wrong, I love **writing**, but now it's become something that has pressure to it which was **_NEVER_** the intended purpose. It was actually supposed to be the exact opposite of that. A place for me to speak not for the approval of others.

As real and transparent as I have been in my posts, it still feels as though I'm showing myself only when I overcome something or learn some great, godly wisdom. I also feel that's hindering my ability to write more often. It's become a habit to only come to write to share my victories or my lessons. And I want that to change ASAP.

The past few weeks I've been running again to get back in shape for my cross country season and when I was on a run a while ago I felt like God was saying to me, "Just as you're training your body every day, your spirit's gotta do the same."

Ouch.

Trust God to come through and tell me my spirit's out of shape HAHA! But I really do wanna take what He said to heart. So now, for the next 2 weeks I want to challenge myself to **write** every single day on here. Try to do something new to listen for Him, and just **write** every day. I know the posts will get tedious and also many will probably suck, but honestly I think that's a good thing. I want to break out of my pattern of following the same routine every post.

I had an _amazing_ conversation yesterday and a phrase that really stuck out to me was, "this is a foundation-building season." Yo CMON, tell me that isn't heat! Nasty. I think God's gonna do a lot of things this coming season and it's gonna **change** very fast, so a strong foundation's the only thing that's gonna keep me from falling. This is all part of that. So as I go into this challenge I'm looking forward to all that God's gonna speak to me about, all the barriers He's gonna break, all the **change** He's gonna bring. I'm excited for this.

Guess I'll see you tomorrow.
