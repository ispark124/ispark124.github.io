I feel like there's a lot on my mind as of late but I don't really know what to say. I think I'll start with an apology. This blog was started a while ago to share my journey through life in an open and transparent way—to process my thoughts in a very public domain. To be honest, I feel like I haven't done particularly well in being transparent about my own shortcomings. In general, I think the world is so afraid to be **vulnerable** and any sign of it is a sign of **weakness**. This space was supposed to be going against this worldly idea of invincibility but I feel like I've just been adding to it. So I'm sorry.  
  
The thing is, without **vulnerability** there can never be true healing or growth. Of course I know this in my head but to truly believe it and live it out is another thing completely. This blog has been great for me to show how I've been learning new truths about God and, through those truths, myself, or to show a revelation about the questions I've been having. But I'm afraid that I can see how this formula is all that this blog has been becoming. I fear that this whole operation is just becoming another highlight reel of my life and almost boasting about the insights I've been having into life or how strong of a person I am. Honestly, I've been scared that if I'm **vulnerable** people would lose their trust in me or I'd be seen as **weak** or I'd be hurt. But now, I want to trust that what I'm saying can be used regardless of my status with other people. Ultimately, I will boast all the more gladly about my **weakness** so that His power may rest on me.  
  
Now we're getting into it LOL.  
  
I think, overall, I feel like a fraud. Maybe I've just forgotten a lot of the lessons I've learned before or maybe I'm being tested in ways that I've definitely failed before. Regardless, I'm tired of trying to be strong enough or smart enough or wise enough; I can't do it and it's exhausting. I want to stop pretending like I have all the answers or like I know best. These days, I've kinda been living life on autopilot and trusting my foundations to get me through each day. I haven't really been living my life out of overflow, and it's felt like I've been living life off of the fruits of this last season. I don't feel like I'm being poured into or being given life but it feels like I'm trying to give people something I don't have. I feel inadequate and **weak** and small and that kinda sucks.  
  
I'm usually known for being stable and dependable, but I'm tired. I feel like I want to be selfish and do things because I want to. I'm tired of waiting for better things to come when I can have fun, unsustainable things right now. I want to be reckless and do things I know will lead to hurt and pain. I want to lose myself. I'm losing myself.

I've lost my Source.

I'm tired because I'm the one who's been trying to be big enough, to be strong enough. There's a God who already is all of that for me so I don't have to be. I've been telling some of my friends about this God who is love and peace and joy, but I'm highkey forgetting who He says He is too. I'm forgetting how bad He wants relationship with me and to be so much more than a morality that I blindly follow. I'm forgetting the history that we have, of Him pulling me out of dark places and saving my life. I'm forgetting His love for me.  
  
I don't really know how to end this with a neat little bow like I've usually done. It's been a week. But, if this past week has shown me anything, it's that I'm still a **weak** person. I am not strong. I am not able. But the thing is, that's okay. That's okay because I don't have to be. I still need reminding every single day about the God who is strong enough to hold me and all of my inadequacy and still say that He loves me. I think we all need that reminder sometimes. Thanks for allowing me to be **vulnerable**.
