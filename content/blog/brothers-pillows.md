My **brother's** name is Jeremiah and he's 10 years old. I am 6 _whole_ years older than he is, but there are times where God sits me down and shows me how much of a little kid I am.  
  
Honestly, I'm a pretty sucky older **brother**.. Last night Jeremiah and I were up late, wayy past his bedtime, we were playing around and as usual it went a little out of hand. We always like to take each others' **pillows** and hide them or we try and scare each other (or both), and pretty much always turns to us tickling each other or something along those lines.  
  
Last night I took his one of his many **pillows** and I threw it downstairs into the living room. I know, I'm a terrible **brother**, but that's not even the worst part. My dad comes out just as Jeremiah was going to get his **pillow**. He then continues to get mad at Jeremiah about how late it is and how loud he was being and saying it all very loudly as Jeremiah was trying to explain how his amazing older **brother** (he didn't say that but he was talking about me), was the one that threw his **pillow** downstairs in the first place. At this point, Jeremiah's crying and all _I_ can do is stare at my dark ceiling, knowing that it was 100% my fault. I mean my dad could've handled the whole thing better, but I can make another post about my parents' parenting. After he gets his **pillow**, my **brother** walks into our room and I haven't heard him crying this hard in a while. I'm silent. I feel terrible. I know I should apologize, but in that moment all I do is stare at the darkness. I wait until his crying stops for a moment and I say, "I'm sorry Jeremiah." Slowly and through his tears he says,

**"It's ok."**

It was at this moment when I felt the Lord. Not because of anything that I had done but what my **brother** did. I was reminded of Jesus and His love for us. My little brother, took the blame for me, took the yelling from our dad, came into our room, and then forgave me. I realized how I haven't been a very loving **brother**, not in the way that he has, not in the way that He has. But Jeremiah, still crying, was able to forgive me. I'm amazed.  
  
As I thinking last night about writing this, I became overwhelmed with gratitude that I even came to the point of this realization. I've been asking myself every day, "How can I listen for God today?" One day it's in a closet and another through my own **brother**, and it's insane how humbled I am from this. I'm sure thousands of moments like this have just slipped right past me because I wasn't listening.  
  
I'm a terrible **brother**, but I'm working on it. Just thankful that I have someone to look up to. Thanks for showing me how to be a good **brother** Jeremiah, love you.
