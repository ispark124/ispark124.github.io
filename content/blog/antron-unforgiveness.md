I had a really great conversation today. This one was with a lot of the leaders of my youth group during a zoom call. We just wrapped up our series of _The Storyteller_, a sermon series about how Jesus taught through his stories and dropped knowledge straight through them. The topic of our discussion today was **forgiveness**.  
  
**Forgiveness** is a massive topic that I _love_ to talk about and have many, many opinions on, but for this post, I'd just like to talk about what I've discovered over the years about **unforgiveness** (the two go hand in hand). My favorite quote about **unforgiveness** is this:

**"Unforgiveness is like drinking poison, thinking it will kill another person when you're really just killing yourself."**

The bitterness and the hate that comes from **unforgiveness** is a bondage, one that the more you hold on, the tighter its grip gets. I'm reminded of a man by the name of **Antron** **McCray**. He was one the five teenage boys that were wrongly accused of the rape and brutal beating of a woman in Central Park in 1989. He as well as the four other boys accused spent five to thirteen years in jail for crimes that they never commited. There's a whole Netflix show on it, _[When They See Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3F9n_smGWY)_, probably one of the most horrifying, amazing shows I've ever seen and that jawn had me in TEARS. But the reason I bring it up, the reason I bring **Antron** **McCray** up is because of his **unforgiveness**. His father told him when he was being interrogated by the police that if he told the police what they wanted to hear, he would be ok, he would be free. So **Antron** signed a confession to a crime he never committed, which led to years of time being taken from him that he'd never get back. In every interview I've watched of **Antron**, this story in his memory always comes up, bubbling up his hate and **unforgiveness** towards his father. To this day, **Antron** is eaten up by this complete, utter hatred. Bobby McCray, his father, died in 1997 and when asked in an interview if he ever made peace he said,

**“No, I didn't want to. My life is ruined. Why should I? He was a coward.”**

That breaks my heart. When my mom and I were watching the interview after the Netflix show she said, "Even though he's freed from prison, his **unforgiveness** still keeps him in bondage" (a paraphrase to make it sound more insightful). But the point is, he is still in chains and he was never truly freed. He's stuck drinking that poison thinking somehow it will change things, somehow he'll feel better, yet is father is dead and **Antron** is still suffering. Wow. I don't know if after nearly 30 years he'll ever be free. Because the thing is, **forgiveness** never really is for the person that hurt you, **forgiveness** is for yourself.  
  
I think what's beautiful is that Jesus, whether you're a Christian or not, preached **forgiveness**. We all sin every single day without fail and yet He also **forgives** us every time without fail. What He wants from us is that we return the favor to others, and it's so good for us anyways. Honestly, I never want to end up like **Antron**, he's come to a place where the thought of his father kills him inside and his father isn't even alive – that's control. **Forgiveness** is growth and maturity, beyond what the other person did, whether they even apologize or not.  
  
This post kind of went off from what the conversation was about but I'll definitely be talking more about **forgiveness** later. I encourage everyone to **forgive** someone that comes to mind, or ask the Lord to present someone to you, I think it's so important to our faith and just being a healthy person.  
  
Also WATCH THE SERIES! I cannot explain how amazing it is! Please!
