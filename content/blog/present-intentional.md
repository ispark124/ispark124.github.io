Today I was gonna write about something completely different but I felt compelled to write this after a conversation I had. This blog should be a place where I keep myself accountable and in check throughout my day and my week. So this is kinda where I'm at:  
  
Recently I've been having really high highs and pretty low lows. I have practice in the morning and I'm always up (not so) bright and early at 7:30 every day. I go for my run and I feel amazing. I'm active and I'm doing something good for my body so I don't feel super anxious and restless the rest of the day, which happens when I don't run. Right after practice I've been seeing some friends or mowing lawns, something that's also really productive in my eyes. I still feel great, I'm definitely tired but I'm doing amazing. Throughout all of this I'm really trying to listen for the Lord. I wake up and I ask God, "What's on your heart today?" As I'm running I try to converse with Him or just be grateful I can even run and take in the beauty of the morning. I go on to do things that better myself, strengthening relationships or making some bank. By the time _all_ of that is done, it's only 12:00. Then things start to go a little downhill.  
  
By the time I'm home and I'm showered, I feel tired. Physically I'm worn out and don't want to do anything. The rest of the day moves deprecatingly slow. I waste my time on the couch or my bed. I waste my time on my phone or my laptop. I pick up a book every once in a while but I feel like I'm losing some kind of meaning. I'm not really living. It seems like my life happens all before 12 o'clock.  
  
I've been telling myself that I want to live a better story but is that what this looks like? Sometimes I go on a long bike ride after dinner just to do something even if I'm so tired. Eventually I go to bed and wake up to live a great morning — not day because that's too long. I live for about 4 and a half hours a day.  
  
As tough as this sounds, this is where I'm at. Don't get me wrong, I'm still learning a lot. I still hear from God after 12:00, it's not like I just sit in one spot staring at the wall. Like I said, I actually feel amazing a lot of the time but I feel like I can't do anything. I think I'm ok where I'm at right not but not ok with just being ok. So these are just things I wanna work on: living **intentionally**, I want to go about my day with a purpose even if I'm not necessarily doing anything I want it to be an **intentional** time; and listening for God, not just in the morning but throughout the whole day.  
  
Today's post isn't some kind of lesson or amazing revelation I've had. Probably the opposite actually. I'm living in a mundane cycle and I wanna break out. Right now I'm living a filler episode, but I don't have an excuse since I'm the writer. I'm being absent to my own story. So this is just a reminder and a call to action for myself: be **intentional** in your life. Be **present** in your own story, Isaiah.
