Everyone has those "on days" where everything is going real great and everything's in line. But everyone also has those "**off** **days**" or maybe even "**off** **weeks**," where things may not be necessarily bad, but they just aren't falling into place. Currently I feel like things for me have been a little **off**. I'm not really sure of what it has to do with, could be a lot of things, but regardless I've been having trouble falling asleep, praying without getting distracted, even just being with my family. This has been going on for about a week and I'm pretty sick of it haha.  
  
I recently started a bible plan with my friend (not to go off on a tangent but I think these are so dope and if you ever wanna start one just shoot me a text, I'm so down). This one is about "dangerous prayers," about not having a repetitive, dull prayers but making it a passion-filled experience with the Father and reaching out for Him. Recently, I find myself changing the way that I pray. My youth pastor would use the term "vending machine prayer," where we put in our coins (religious things that we think earn God's love), and choose whatever we want from the vending machine, the thing is, God's not a vending machine or some genie in a bottle but really a relational being. Not only that but this plan talks about surrendering ourselves and allowing God into our **fears**.

**"As God reveals your fears, He will also build your faith."**

This is such a powerful statement. By revealing exactly what we **fear** it shows us where we're not really trusting God and shows us where we are weak. As I've been in this **off** season, a lot of my **fears** have been getting revealed. I find myself seeking the approval of so many people, which I've always known was around but it's evident especially in this quarantine season. I have a large family (six members) and it's always a big deal whenever we go out and I'm realizing that I hate going shopping now. I can't stand the looks that we get from travelling as a family, and being Asian really doesn't help. I don't know why but I get so uncomfortable by the way that people look at me and my family, even if I know it's nothing harmful. I'm becoming so sensitive, so **afraid** of what others think. I need them to feel ok. What God is showing me now is breaking this feeling that I need to be approved by others.  
  
I'm reminded of the story of the woman with [the alabaster jar](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A7%2CMark%2014%3A3%2CLuke%207%3A37&version=ESV), a story of a woman that broke a precious jar of very expensive oil over Jesus' feet and washed them. I'm reminded of this because this jar must've been her entire life savings – her _security_. She chose to break at Jesus' feet as an act of worship and surrender, by breaking the jar (no putting that jawn back together) she left all of her security and put her trust in Jesus. Without a doubt the woman had **off days** but still she chose to worship the Lord and gave up so much.  
  
I feel like things for me are still **off** but I think that's ok. I think the thing that does matter is whether I'm still choosing to listen to God during these times, whether I'm still choosing to allow surrender, whether I'm still choosing to acknowledge my fears. My mentor told me that worship isn't whether you feel it or not, but worship should be an act of stepping out into faith, knowing that God has your back, no matter what. I'm a strong believer in that, and whether I'm feeling on or **off**, I know I can still worship the one I love.  
  
I'm still thinking through a lot of these things as I'm writing them down but I know they're hitting me right where it's supposed to. This reminds me of the song [Way Maker by Leeland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJCV_2H9xD0). The bridge goes:

"Even when I don't see it, You're working  
Even when I don't feel it, You're working  
You never stop, You never stop working  
You never stop, You never stop working"

And I think that's all that really needs to be said.
