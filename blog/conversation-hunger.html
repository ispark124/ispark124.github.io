<p>Today I'm gonna do a Stream of Consciousness exercise so I'm just gonna write the first thing that comes to my mind, typos and all for 10 minutes. Then I'll read it over and reflect after. We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Birthday party.<br>Today was my brother's 11th birthday.<br>I don't remember my 11th birthday.<br>Birthday's have never really been a big deal to me.<br>I wonder why.<br>I know some people get really into their birthday and expect real elaborate parties, gifts, and all of that.<br>I've never been into that.<br>Wow my mind just blanked.<br>This is pretty weird just writing my thoughts like this, it's just whatever I'm thinking and the first thing I'll write down.<br>Of course I'm being super transparent too, no erasing even if I say something stupid.<br>Hahah that's funny.<br>I hate the feeling of eating because you're bored.<br>I do it all the time but it's never satisfying.<br>I wonder why.<br>Eating like that is kind of like trying to fill something other than your <strong>hunger</strong> that really won't be filled by food.<br>Reminds me of that story of the Samaritan woman at the well and Jesus said to her that His living water won't ever make her thirsty.<br>Our bodies are extremely capabale of living in terrible conditions even past the point of <strong>hunger</strong>.<br>Dude, that show <em>Alone</em> is crazy.<br>Apparently if you get so <strong>hungry</strong> your body eats at its fat reserves, that's how you lose a lot of fat if you starve yourself<br>But apparently if you run out of fat, your body starts to eat at your muscle, including your heart and brain.<br>That's WILD!<br>In a way I think that's what our spiritual <strong>hunger's</strong> kinda like.<br>If we get so <strong>hungry</strong> but we don't eat what God's offering us we start to eat away at our own bodies, hurting ourseves in the process.<br>My sister's in a relationship right now with a guy that I don't think she even likes.<br>Of course she lieks him but I think it's just to feed an emotional hole that she can find in him.<br>But what do I know.<br>I really don't talk with my siblings about that and that makes me kinda sad.<br>Someone mentioned the three different kinds of <strong>conversations</strong> that people have.<br>The people that wade in the shallows of a pool, so those are <strong>conversations</strong> like, "Hey how you doing? Weather was crazy yesterday, huh?"<br>Then there's people that go scuba diving, which is a little deeper, "How's your family doing? You doing ok?"<br>Then there's the deep sea divers, "How does that really make you feel? Why do you think you reacted that way?"<br>I don't think I've ever had a deep sea <strong>conversation</strong> with my siblings.</p>

<p>First off, this was an awesome exercise and I'll definitely do more. Secondly, this sucked.<br>I did <em>not</em> mean to say all that or anything but it was the first things that came to my head. I guess in a way it's kind of what I care about and it bubbles up naturally in my thoughts. <br><br>There are a lot of things that I could go over from all of this. I don't mean to call out my sister at all but actually in a way I think we're all like that sometimes. We feel this kind of <strong>hunger</strong> for something more and just reach out for anything that we think will grab us back. Even if in the end, the thing we reach out for will be the first thing to drop us if given the chance. I mean Jesus said it himself, He provides the bread of Life and the living water so that we'll never go <strong>hungry</strong> or never go thirsty again. Of course we choose to turn away from that for food that we constantly have to eat again. I think I'm like that with my identity. I put my trust in myself and what I can do, how fast I can run, how good my grades. I take those things and I turn away from what God can provide for me. He can sustain me yet still I chose to barely hold myself up and eventually fall with my trust.<br><br>This also made me think about my family. Am I even close to my siblings? It can't be just me but I think saying "I love you" to my siblings is so hard. Of course I do love them and I do show it (sometimes) but why is that so hard? I was at a friend's house for the Fourth of July and to see how close her and her siblings are really made me think. My siblings and I are all close and we know we love each other, but I don't remember the last <em>real</em>, deep sea <strong>conversation</strong> I've had with them. About spirituality, about love, about questions, about concerns, about relationships, about life. Isn't that what family's supposed to be there for? <br><br>I haven't talked to my siblings in years. <br><br>Yeah this exercise sucked. It forced me for 10 minutes to think and do nothing else but think. These are probably thoughts I have normally but they're so fleeting and nothing permanent, just something that passes by and nothing to reflect on. So much of this stuff I've never even thought to put into words but it must've come from somewhere. Damn. This was only 10 minutes too, imagine if it was any longer. There's so much being revealed, the things that I think about and what bothers me. I'll be thinking about what I wrote today for a long time. I'll definitely do this again no doubt. But for now what I can do is not just reflect on the thoughts I had but do something with it. I'm not gonna let these thoughts just sit here to be a show, but I'm gonna try to act on these. Go back to the source that won't make me <strong>hungry</strong> and finally have some <strong>conversation</strong> with my siblings. I gotta start doing something different with my life. </p>
