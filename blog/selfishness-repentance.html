<p>About an hour ago I was sitting and I was thinking of something to write about and couldn't think of anything. I was thinking about my day and nothing really memorable or worth writing about came to mind. Then a few moments later I got scolded by my mom and I realized how <strong>selfish</strong> I've been today and I think today I'm called to <strong>repent</strong>.<br><br>The reason I was being scolded was pretty much my fault, I don't think I can put it any other way, I mean, I definitely can blame it on someone else but I think I gotta take this one. Because of COVID and our lack of face masks, my family and I decided we'd start to make our own. Really it was my mom's idea which, if you know my mom, probably isn't much of a surprise. Anyways today was the first day we started making the masks and after my mom and I went and bought our fabric we got home and started working on the masks. It probably took around 2 hours finding a mask design we wanted to make and also actually putting it together with our sewing machine (we're not expert crafty people), but it got done. Around 7:00 my parents had to leave for a meeting, but my mom said to me, "Isaiah, you're in charge of making sure the other kids get their masks done." I mean, since I was the only one who actually knew what to do that made sense. But my mask was done and I was tired and I really didn't feel like doing the whole process again, so I sat on the couch and told my siblings to cut the mask shape out of the fabric and that was it. Honestly I kind of forgot the other steps after that and since my mom was the only one who knew how to sew our masks, I just left it at where I thought the last step was before actually sewing. Spoiler alert, I was wrong. My mom came down after an hour and a half to just see cut up pieces of fabric and I think she might've possibly maybe been just a little bit annoyed. She got mad at my siblings, which I felt kind of bad about, but then proceeded to tell me off about how I was supposed to be in charge and this and that was supposed to be done. And yeah. Here I am now, hiding from my family and writing this. <br><br>Maybe on a normal day or any other occasion I probably would've been upset at my mom for getting mad or my siblings for not, somehow, telling me what I was supposed to let them know. But I think because I've really been trying to listen for something more in my every day and write about all these types of moments, I see this more as a reflective moment. I'm upset at myself for being so <strong>selfish</strong>. My mask was done, I did my work, I was chilling. So instead of really helping my siblings and doing the work, I gave them vague instructions and almost reluctantly told them what to do (I know, I'm a great brother). The thing is though, all the work that I failed to help with, my mom had to come and do what I couldn't. She's the one who had to come pick up after my (figurative and literal) fabric scraps. I felt bad; I <em>feel</em> bad. <br><br>Looking back, I think I've been pretty <strong>selfish</strong> the whole day. I've been so concerned about my physical exam to get cleared for cross country practice; I kept shoving papers to my parents for them to sign, constantly nagging them about my schedule and what I had to do, and really just caring about myself today. I believe God's been telling me that I have to listen more to myself and care about what I think in order to get better about not caring what other people think about me, but I think this was a whole different direction than what He meant. <br><br>So I <strong>repent</strong> over what I did and what I've been doing today. I'm still far from perfect, but I think I can say that I'm happy with myself for catching my mistakes. God, I'm sorry for being so <strong>selfish</strong>, and to my family, I apologize. It's so hard to be selfless and to make it just a natural reaction to things is another beast entirely, but through this time I pray that I can be more like you Jesus. Thanks for opening my eyes again.<br><br>Now that I've done and said all that, I'd just like the record to show that I'm like 99% sure the three girls in my house are PMS'ing. That doesn't make what I did any less bad or the reaction any less deserved, but I just want myself to feel better :)) But I guess God can still move through hyper-sensitive women and touch the lives of people like me, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you God and thanks to my family for telling me where I can stick it. </p>
