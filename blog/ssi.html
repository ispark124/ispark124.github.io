                    <p>Yesterday I sat in a closet for over an hour in silence. I sat there just listening. Listening for an answer to a question I never even asked.<br><br>A close friend told me that when we pray, we do so much talking and asking and filling up empty space that we never take time to listen. I think that the people that are the most uncomfortable with silence are the ones that have the issues that scream the loudest. No one wants to address their problems, no one wants to be alone with their thoughts, <strong>silence and solitude</strong> does both. By not talking, it allows what's really troubling us to rise up and we can address what's there and invite God to come in. I sat in that closet and did just that. <br><br>King David and Bathsheba. As I was sitting in the <strong>silence</strong> this story came into my mind. David was a good man, described to be a man after God's own heart. But when he was crowned King, something happened and he became a terrible, lustful man and his true colors are quite evident in his affair with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11 - <em>wild </em>story). As I was reflecting on this story I didn't know what God was saying to me yet, I wasn't getting the full picture. Until I thought about his life after all of this. Yeah, I thought that his affair was insane (straight out of some TV show) but the craziest thing was, David gets <em>redeemed</em>. This murderous sex addict is redeemed and put in a higher place. God took this relationship and used it for His glory. David and Bathsheba get put directly into the lineage of Jesus Christ. Fully restored and fully redeemed.</p>

                    <p>I'm at a point where sometimes it's hard to look in a mirror. I turn away from God time and time again, I've done things that I feel He could never forgive (which I know is a lie). But now, I take a look at King David. This mans killed one of his soldiers to have sex with his wife, yet God still looked at this addict and chose to love him. By His overwhelming love for Him despite his despicable actions he lifted David up.</p>

                    <p>I was never looking for something going into that closet, but still I found comfort. He showed me another example of His amazing grace to help me face my sins. To help me face myself. Through this time and this season, God's revealing more and more of His character to me, and all I have to do is listen. Stop asking, stop talking, stop filling up space and just sit. And right there is where I find Him, right in the <strong>silence and solitude</strong>.</p>
