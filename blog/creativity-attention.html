<p>These days it's been hard for me to be <strong>creative</strong>. I don't remember the last time I picked up my pen to draw or the last time I opened my computer to write. It's kind of funny, I feel like I'm always starting these posts with how I haven't written in a while and end them with how I hope to write more but this time feels a little different. There has been an actual lack of output, and not in the unhealthy, hyper-productive way but in the desire for <strong>creativity</strong> kind of way. This past summer I can definitively tell you times where I had opportunities to <strong>create</strong> something beautiful based on what was happening in my life but chose to ignore it. Call it a lack of time or motivation, call it laziness, whatever it is, it's definitely there.<br><br>But, to be honest, I feel like my life hasn't been significantly worse because I'm not doing these things or not expressing myself <strong>creatively</strong> and there hasn't really been this desire in me to keep it up. It's this way of thinking that terrifies me—that somehow I've been ok with sitting back and denying a greater capacity for beauty in my life. I've been comfortable with living below the standard of beauty and <strong>creativity</strong> that I should have in my life. As humans, <strong>creativity</strong> is an innate part of our design, being made in the image of God, the first Creator. I can't say that I have fully been living in that part of my identity and I don't want to be ok with knowing I'm not living in my full function and capacity as a <strong>creative</strong>—as a human. <br><br>If I'm really thinking hard, it seems that the root of my issue here is that I haven't been inspired. <strong>Creativity</strong> is the end product, but it's inspiration that is the means to get there, and I don't think I've been having an adequate amount of intake in order to produce something meaningful. Actually, maybe it's not even the <em>amount</em> of intake but the <em>quality</em> of what I'm drawing my inspiration from. I don't have to think that hard to see that the places that have my attention right now are not places where creativity is or can be fostered. <br><br>And that brings me to another point that's been on my mind as of late. There are two areas in my life that I feel like the Lord has highlighted pretty recently and I'm starting to think they're much more connected than they are separated. The first area being the <strong>creative</strong> stop I've felt like I've had and the second area being the different things that are holding my <strong>attention</strong>. Imma be real, I hate the amount of time I've spent on my phone on social media or YouTube or chess lol. Of course, I follow some really great life-giving, inspiring pages and channels that cut through the fantasy of the digital world, but in the end that space has not become a place of growth for me. I don't think that space was ever intended for anyone to truly grow in the ways that mean anything.<br><br>I heard a quote recently and I think it's the reason why so much of this has been on my mind. It goes,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">"what you give your <strong>attention</strong> to is the person you become. Put another way: the mind is the portal to the soul, and what you fill your mind with will shape the trajectory of your character. In the end, your life is no more than the sum of what you gave your <strong>attention</strong> to. That bodes well for those apprentices of Jesus who give the bulk of their <strong>attention</strong> to him and to all that is good, beautiful, and true in his world. But not for those who give their <strong>attention</strong> to the 24-7 news cycle of outrage and anxiety and emotion-charged drama or the nonstop feed of celebrity gossip, titillation, and cultural drivel. (As if we "give" it in the first place; much of it is stolen by a clever algorithm out to monetize our precious <strong>attention</strong>.) But again: we become what we give our attention to, for better or worse.” <br>- John Mark Comer</p>

<p>Your life is no more than the sum of what you give your <strong>attention</strong> to. Damn.<br><br>I don't want what's been holding my <strong>attention </strong>these days go be a reflection of my life, but the truth is wherever you invest your <strong>attention</strong> into is what you find ultimately important. I'm beginning to see that the solution to my <strong>creativity</strong> problem isn't forcing myself to create more but fixing my eyes on the One from whom <strong>creativity</strong> flows. He is both the source and the supply—the water and the well. By focusing on things that inspire me, I am able to create, I am able to live. These days I've been completely shutting off my phone for hours at a time and through the night which has been so great. I get to focus on where I am, be intentional about what I'm doing, and allow myself to be bored—my mom always said that boredom breeds <strong>creativity</strong> and I really think she's right. <br><br>With all the changes I'm making in my life, hopefully I can say that for the rest of the summer I'll be bored. But hey that's a good thing now, that means for the rest of the summer I'll be <strong>creating</strong>.</p>
