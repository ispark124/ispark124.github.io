<p>I always start these with a &quot;wow I haven&#39;t written in so long, glad we&#39;re back&quot; kinda thing, and this time I&#39;m not gonna do that. I guess in a way I did, but in a cool meta way. Alright, anyways, for those that aren&#39;t caught up: I&#39;m gonna be living in Austin this <strong>summer</strong> for 11 weeks. I&#39;m gonna be working full time, living on my own, and doing my best to live out a story worth telling.</p>
<p>I feel like I have all these grandiose ideas of what this <strong>summer</strong> is gonna look like. It&#39;s gonna be life-changing, it&#39;s gonna be dynamic, and whatever it is it&#39;s gonna be huge. There&#39;s change like I&#39;ve never really lived before—moving across the country by myself, working in a company I could potentially be at in the future, getting plugged into new communities. Why wouldn&#39;t my expectations for this <strong>summer</strong> be massive?</p>
<p>But when I think about it and come down from my daydreaming I&#39;m reminded that life isn&#39;t lived in the big pictures—it&#39;s in the every day, the mundane, the commonplace. It&#39;s in choosing to be kind to the grocery store worker or remembering to take out the trash or treating my friends to a meal just because. The thing is, I have so many goals for this <strong>summer</strong>: getting really good at cooking, running again, reading a ton, building lasting community here, falling deeper in <strong>love</strong> with the Lord (keep me accountable on any one of those please :)). But on top of big pictures, life also isn&#39;t lived in spreadsheets, goal tracking, or my journals. Unfortunate to be honest because everything&#39;s perfect there. So I guess the question for this <strong>summer</strong>—for every day really—is how do I wanna live my life?</p>
<p>I&#39;m sitting here writing this in a hotel room on my way down to Texas and I can&#39;t help but reflect on my drive down. I came down with my siblings, and gosh it&#39;s been so much fun but also no one knows how to push your buttons like your siblings. For someone who talks about <strong>love</strong> so often, you would think it&#39;d be so easy, but on day 2 of driving, over 15 hours in, post mountain hike you&#39;re faced with <strong>love</strong> like a slap in the face. It&#39;s funny how this grand <strong>summer</strong> has to start where anything good always does, with the journey there and filled with the choices to <strong>love</strong>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is the right time to do it, but this is my blog so I&#39;m gonna do it anyways. I feel like I haven&#39;t really written out what I believe <strong>love</strong> is. What does it even mean to <strong>love</strong> someone? At first, I was thinking it is considering someone as more important than yourself. While I think that&#39;s part of it, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a complete picture to do <strong>love</strong> justice—it&#39;s gotta be externally sourced. We are fickle people and even how much we <strong>love</strong> ourselves fluctuates. I think <strong>Love</strong> has to be loving someone the way God does. Seeing them the way He does. Listening to, caring for, sacrificing for, dying for someone the way He does. <strong>Love</strong> is weighty, it&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s costly.</p>
<p>Of course I have to think of Jesus&#39; words when asked about the greatest commandment, &quot;And you shall <strong>love</strong> the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.&#39; The second is this: &#39;You shall <strong>love</strong> your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.&quot; What really struck me as I was re-reading this passage in Mark, was the response of the scribe who asked Jesus this question. He understood it. He responded with, &quot;to <strong>love</strong> [God] with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to <strong>love</strong> one&#39;s neighbor as oneself, <em>is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices</em>.&quot; At the time, the burnt offerings and sacrifices were the religious rituals people did to atone for sins or express their devotion to God. But what the scribe&#39;s saying flips it entirely on its head—if you claim Christianity but don&#39;t <strong>love</strong> God or His people you&#39;ve missed the point.</p>
<p><strong>Love</strong> is what Jesus came to do.</p>
<p>Shoot, how did I end up here? Ok, bringing it back full circle lol. This <strong>summer</strong> is going to be incredible. Yes, I have big plans and goals and things I wanna do, but that&#39;s not what makes up my life. This <strong>summer</strong> is going to be incredible because it is going to be about <strong>love</strong>. <strong>Love</strong> in the ordinary and in the mundane. Not big and flashy, but in sacrifice and choice. So going back to the question, how do I wanna live my life? <strong>Love</strong> like Jesus.</p>
