<p>I started writing this blog about a week and a half ago, kind of reflecting on the past year and what I've been learning while also thinking about what this next semester is going to hold. I didn't post it because (1) I wasn't finished lol and (2) it seems like even in the short week I've been here, there's always still more for me to learn and think about. But yeah, I think there are a couple things I wanna do differently this semester and hopefully, I'll be able to stick with it.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, last year was an incredible year of <strong>growth</strong>. How could it not be when you're thrown into a completely new environment with new people and new things to discover everywhere? New is definitely a word that characterized the last year and always being surrounded by that forced me to expand in almost every aspect of my life. That is until I got used to the new and it became standard. Reflecting on just how much I used to consider unknown has shown me how much of what was foreign has become familiar, and that definitely led to weeks of <strong>complacency</strong> throughout the year. I wouldn't say that I was regressing in any way; my work was getting done, I was meeting with the Lord and my friends, and I was getting good sleep. These are definitely all great things, but looking back, I feel like I was meeting the minimum in order to not fall back. I was satisfied with where I was at because I wasn't "falling behind." At our school that is 100% an accomplishment in itself and I do want to be proud of that, but at the same time, I don't want to just do the minimum. I want to <strong>grow</strong>.</p>

<p>I wrote that question a week and a half ago and my friend actually asked me that a couple nights ago and it brought me back to what I wrote here before. It's honestly a hard question to answer and I really had to think about how I was going to fight against <strong>complacency</strong> or even the desire to achieve things that really don't mean anything. Everyone seems to be striving for things that ultimately don't bear any fruit—myself included. So the question remains: how do I fight against something that is so prevalent, so natural, so worldly?<br /><br />I think for me it all comes down to my mentality and being constantly reminded of my identity and my purpose. I am not here to get good grades, I am not here to become an engineer, shoot, I'm not even here to get a degree. I'm here because God has a plan for me that He wants to work <em>in</em> me and <em>through</em> me, and He thought the best place I needed to be for that is here. <br /><br />You know, people often ask me how it is that I am so chill about work and school, how I don't get stressed about exams and finals and things like that. I usually make a joke like, "Oh yeah it's because I don't care about school," and then laugh it off. But I guess that's really only a half-truth. The reason I am the way I am about school and classes and grades is because my identity is not rooted in them. Whether I somehow become valedictorian or have the lowest GPA in school history, who I am won't change and I cannot defined by some number a temporary institution gives me. But the things I will be caring about and asking myself at the end of these four years are: Have I made meaningful and lasting relationships with people? Have I been a good and faithful servant? Have I learned to love?<br /><br />I'm reminded of a quote that I actually wrote about wayyy back in 2020 in my post on <a href="https://isaiahscorner.com/blog/likes-followers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likes & followers</a>. Oh, how the times have changed but I’m still relearning the same lessons. It was a quote by Bob Goff that seems to sum up a lot of what I'm saying in a sentence.</p>

<p>There's a superstition here on campus that if you walk through the main front gates you won't graduate on time. I had a vision a week ago of an army marching straight through those gates ready for battle, armed with swords, spears, and shields, ready to take over the school. Last night, as we were walking back from a CU Nova event, a few of the frosh guys walked straight through those gates, knowing full well about the superstition. I mean everyone was laughing, they filmed themselves, and we were all just having a good time, but in my head, something powerful happened. Sure, it might not be that deep and it's just a fun school-wide superstition, but I believe this is a declaration. We're saying that there is no fear or anxiety over our academics or anything else that seems to matter here—the God who made the universe is on our side. He's the one that dictates the narrative.<br /><br />So yeah, <strong>growing</strong> is reminding myself to pour myself into the places that matter. I wanna go back to that newness and excitement I felt as a freshman. Gosh, I feel like this post is a culmination of everything I've been learning from <em>all</em> of my blogs this past year. I'm really out here just getting beat by the same lesson in different flavors lol. But yes, I'm here fighting against <strong>complacency</strong>. I’m fighting against the comfortability that comes with wanting the things that don’t feed my soul. Pray for me. Ask me how my fight's going. Hopefully, I can tell you of some victories.</p>
