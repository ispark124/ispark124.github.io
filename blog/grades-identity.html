<p>It seems like such a stupid thing to talk about <strong>grades</strong> on here. It seems like such an insignificant part of life that really only matters in the context of school and life immediately after it. Yet, with finals season approaching I can&#39;t help but reflect on my relationship with <strong>grades</strong> and the culture surrounding it in general.</p>
<p>I know in my short time here, I&#39;ve gotten the lowest <strong>grades</strong> I ever have in my life and it&#39;s pretty consistent too. B&#39;s and C&#39;s are the new norm (math is ridiculous) and feeling like I know nothing has been insanely humbling. And I can&#39;t say this hasn&#39;t upset me, going from doing well at a relatively relaxed high school to seeing a 30% at a rigorous institution isn&#39;t the best feeling in the world. Like, dang, prof didn&#39;t have to pop off <strong>grading</strong> that harshly like that. So yes, pride wounded, brain shook, but heart is still intact.</p>
<p>To be completely honest, I have no idea how people do this stuff without God. I guess &quot;this stuff&quot; really means life LOL but managing school more specifically. It seems exhausting. There was a time in my life where I definitely took part of my <strong>identity</strong> from the <strong>grades</strong> I got, which at the era of middle school, A&#39;s were easy. If I had that mentality now, I think I&#39;d be crushed. And on top of being crushed, never fully satisfied with myself. And on top of being never fully satisfied with myself, judgmental of other people. It&#39;d just be this endless cycle that would only lead to disappointment.</p>
<p>But let me tell you, thank God I have God. From an outside perspective, it may seem easy to think, &quot;oh wow it seems <em>so</em> convenient you can just not worry about your <strong>grades</strong> and think everything&#39;s just gonna work out.&quot; And you&#39;d be right LOL. I have confidence that everything <em>will</em> work out because that is who He says He is. That&#39;s His <strong>identity.</strong> He&#39;s done it over and over and over in my life before so why would He stop now? As I&#39;ve been living in this truth it&#39;s been so life-giving. Matthew 11: 28-30 (TPT) says,</p>
<p>&quot;Are you weary, carrying a heavy burden? Come to me. I will refresh your life, for I am your oasis. Simply join your life with mine. Learn my ways and you&#39;ll discover that I&#39;m gentle, humble, easy to please. You will find refreshment and rest in me. For all that I require of you will be pleasant and easy to bear.&quot;</p>
<p>Is school still hard? 1000%. Do I still work to do the best I can? Most of the time lol. But the thing that&#39;s different is it&#39;s so much easier to put in the work and do what I have to do knowing that He will not only help me meet Him halfway but also take me the rest of the distance. I have full confidence that if there is somewhere God wants me, I will be there. It&#39;s my joy to be obedient and put in the work on my side to meet Him where He wants me because I know what He has in store for me is greater than anything I could ever imagine.</p>
<p>I definitely needed this reminder today. Kinda just reflecting on this really bad exam I took yesterday, a paper I received, and another paper I had to turn in, it&#39;s easy to get wrapped up in all of it. It&#39;s comforting to know my <strong>identity</strong> doesn&#39;t have to come from the things I do or the <strong>grade</strong> I receive or where I am. I know that before I am a student, before I am anything, I am a citizen of heaven. And that is my <strong>identity</strong>.</p>
