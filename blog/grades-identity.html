<p>It seems like such a stupid thing to talk about <strong>grades</strong> on here. It seems like such an insignificant part of life that really only matters in the context of school and life immediately after it. Yet, with finals season approaching I can’t help but reflect on my relationship with <strong>grades</strong> and the culture surrounding it in general.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know in my short time here, I’ve gotten the lowest <strong>grades</strong> I ever have in my life and it’s pretty consistent too. B’s and C’s are the new norm (math is ridiculous) and feeling like I know nothing has been insanely humbling. And I can’t say this hasn’t upset me, going from doing well at a relatively relaxed high school to seeing a 30% at a rigorous institution isn’t the best feeling in the world. Like, dang, prof didn’t have to pop off <strong>grading</strong> that harshly like that. So yes, pride wounded, brain shook, but heart is still intact.</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I have no idea how people do this stuff without God. I guess “this stuff” really means life LOL but managing school more specifically. It seems exhausting. There was a time in my life where I definitely took part of my <strong>identity</strong> from the <strong>grades</strong> I got, which at the era of middle school, A’s were easy. If I had that mentality now, I think I’d be crushed. And on top of being crushed, never fully satisfied with myself. And on top of being never fully satisfied with myself, judgmental of other people. It’d just be this endless cycle that would only lead to disappointment. </p>

<p>But let me tell you, thank God I have God. From an outside perspective, it may seem easy to think, “oh wow it seems <em>so</em> convenient you can just not worry about your <strong>grades</strong> and think everything’s just gonna work out.” And you’d be right LOL. I have confidence that everything <em>will </em>work out because that is who He says He is. That’s His<em> </em><strong>identity. </strong>He’s done it over and over and over in my life before so why would He stop now? As I’ve been living in this truth it’s been so life-giving. Matthew 11: 28-30 (TPT) says,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">“Are you weary, carrying a heavy burden? Come to me. I will refresh your life, for I am your oasis. Simply join your life with mine. Learn my ways and you’ll discover that I’m gentle, humble, easy to please. You will find refreshment and rest in me. For all that I require of you will be pleasant and easy to bear.”</p>

<p>Is school still hard? 1000%. Do I still work to do the best I can? Most of the time lol. But the thing that’s different is it’s so much easier to put in the work and do what I have to do knowing that He will not only help me meet Him halfway but also take me the rest of the distance. I have full confidence that if there is somewhere God wants me, I will be there. It’s my joy to be obedient and put in the work on my side to meet Him where He wants me because I know what He has in store for me is greater than anything I could ever imagine. </p>

<p>I definitely needed this reminder today. Kinda just reflecting on this really bad exam I took yesterday, a paper I received, and another paper I had to turn in, it’s easy to get wrapped up in all of it. It’s comforting to know my <strong>identity</strong> doesn’t have to come from the things I do or the <strong>grade</strong> I receive or where I am. I know that before I am a student, before I am anything, I am a citizen of heaven. And that is my <strong>identity</strong>. </p>
