<p>This first week of Summer has been rough in ways that I can't fully describe. I think on paper it's gone real well—I've been starting on every single one of my <strong>goals</strong> for the summer and everything else has been going smoothly. The other kids at work have been really kind, I've gotten to run a bit, I've been learning to cook a ton, I've gotten to network some :), and got plugged into some Christian community here. And I think if all of those things were what was truly important I'd be satisfied. But to be completely honest, when Friday rolled around I felt like I was just losing <strong>sight</strong> of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My expectations for this summer were sky-high (I think if you know me at all you'd know I'm a practical idealist), and my eyes have been much bigger than my stomach. I wanna balance all of these <strong>goals</strong> with work with fun with discipline, and in the midst of this great balancing act, I've lost <strong>sight</strong>. Not that I think <strong>goals</strong> are bad, nor do I think doing a lot of things is bad, but I think for me I lost track of what it was all for. It was Friday night in my room and I was staring at my ceiling with one question staring back at me: <em>What am I living for?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it myself? Is it the people around me? Is it something Greater?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These <strong>goals</strong> of mine have pushed me, yes, but they've pushed me to focus more and more on something that fails: myself. Call it pride, call it whatever you will, but I think I've had this idea that I have to be better because that's the expectation I've put on myself—I should know better, act better, be better. My <strong>sight</strong> has been locked in on me. Me, me me. I guess that's fine, but how can I live that way knowing that there <em>is</em> something so much better and greater than I. I think it's super ironic that my last post, characterizing this <a href="https://www.isaiahscorner.com/blog/summer-love.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summer</a>, was all about loving like Jesus and here I am not knowing the first thing about what that looks like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>I heard this quote from Paul Washer, and I can't stop thinking about it. It went something along the lines of, "There are no great men of God, there are only tiny, weak, faithless men of a great and merciful God who have granted them grace." And that's the thing isn't it. I don't want my influence, my talent, my gifting to ever lead back to me—in fact, it can't. I am not a great man. Not even a good one. I think I have to swallow that pill. Because the depth to which I can accept my weakness and my brokenness is the depth to which I can realize just how Loved and Accepted I am.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moral of the story: I suck really bad, and I forgot that. So instead of focusing so much on myself to fix what I know I can't, I need to lock my <strong>sight</strong> on the one who can. That's the real <strong>Goal</strong>. Everything else will fall into place.</p>
