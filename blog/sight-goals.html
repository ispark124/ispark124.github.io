<p>This first week of Summer has been rough in ways that I can&#39;t fully describe. I think on paper it&#39;s gone real well—I&#39;ve been starting on every single one of my <strong>goals</strong> for the summer and everything else has been going smoothly. The other kids at work have been really kind, I&#39;ve gotten to run a bit, I&#39;ve been learning to cook a ton, I&#39;ve gotten to network some :), and got plugged into some Christian community here. And I think if all of those things were what was truly important I&#39;d be satisfied. But to be completely honest, when Friday rolled around I felt like I was just losing <strong>sight</strong> of things.</p>
<p>My expectations for this summer were sky-high (I think if you know me at all you&#39;d know I&#39;m a practical idealist), and my eyes have been much bigger than my stomach. I wanna balance all of these <strong>goals</strong> with work with fun with discipline, and in the midst of this great balancing act, I&#39;ve lost <strong>sight</strong>. Not that I think <strong>goals</strong> are bad, nor do I think doing a lot of things is bad, but I think for me I lost track of what it was all for. It was Friday night in my room and I was staring at my ceiling with one question staring back at me: <em>What am I living for?</em></p>
<p>Is it myself? Is it the people around me? Is it something Greater?</p>
<p>These <strong>goals</strong> of mine have pushed me, yes, but they&#39;ve pushed me to focus more and more on something that fails: myself. Call it pride, call it whatever you will, but I think I&#39;ve had this idea that I have to be better because that&#39;s the expectation I&#39;ve put on myself—I should know better, act better, be better. My <strong>sight</strong> has been locked in on me. Me, me me. I guess that&#39;s fine, but how can I live that way knowing that there <em>is</em> something so much better and greater than I. I think it&#39;s super ironic that my last post, characterizing this <a href="https://www.isaiahscorner.com/blog/summer-love.html">summer</a>, was all about loving like Jesus and here I am not knowing the first thing about what that looks like.</p>
<p>I heard this quote from Paul Washer, and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. It went something along the lines of, &quot;There are no great men of God, there are only tiny, weak, faithless men of a great and merciful God who have granted them grace.&quot; And that&#39;s the thing isn&#39;t it. I don&#39;t want my influence, my talent, my gifting to ever lead back to me—in fact, it can&#39;t. I am not a great man. Not even a good one. I think I have to swallow that pill. Because the depth to which I can accept my weakness and my brokenness is the depth to which I can realize just how Loved and Accepted I am.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: I suck really bad, and I forgot that. So instead of focusing so much on myself to fix what I know I can&#39;t, I need to lock my <strong>sight</strong> on the one who can. That&#39;s the real <strong>Goal</strong>. Everything else will fall into place.</p>
<p>See y&#39;all next week.</p>
