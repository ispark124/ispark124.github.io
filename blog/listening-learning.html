<p>The hardest part of writing every day is the beginning. I have to stare at this blank screen and think of something to write about. I was thinking I should do another writing exercise today like yesterday, but I couldn&#39;t find one online that I liked or wasn&#39;t too cheesy. But also I feel like I had a pretty good day today that I wanna talk about.  </p>
<p>Today I did something a little different when I was getting ready. Normally I have a reminder set for my phone every day that asks, &quot;How can I <strong>listen</strong> to God today?&quot; And honestly, I don&#39;t really pay attention to it anymore because it shows up every day, but today I really thought about it as I was getting ready to go to practice. I thought about it and was asking God to speak to me, which I know He does, and help me to be willing to <strong>listen</strong>. I&#39;m sad to say that that&#39;s pretty much the only time today that I thought about that hahha, but I do think that if I make that a <em>real</em> habit, that&#39;s something that I can always rely on to <strong>listen</strong> for God. So I&#39;m in the very very beginning stages of developing a habit.  </p>
<p>Anyways, practice sucked because the weather all week has been <em>disgustingly</em> humid, but yeah just normal running stuff. I really wanna start talking more about my faith, but I also don&#39;t wanna be shoving it down people&#39;s throats to the point where no one wants to associate themselves with it. For now though, I just wanna show my teammates love and support them and then I know God will provide opportunities for me to present Himself.  </p>
<p>All of my siblings went to this &quot;summer school&quot; type place a family friend has started. It&#39;s really just like 3 hours where they and a couple other kids can go and get their work done away from some distractions. That leaves the house free for just me, and I guess my parents but they don&#39;t make a lot of noise hahah. I&#39;m finding that I want more space for time alone. Even if I may be alone in a room in my house I don&#39;t feel as if I am. I know any second my brother could pop through the door asking if he wants to play a game, or as I lay down I can hear the tv playing in the background. I know the importance of family and I want more relationship like I talked about yesterday, but I think I&#39;m longing for not necessarily isolation but a peaceful space. Boundaries and balance between all of that is being really hard to find.  </p>
<p>I went to my best friend&#39;s house today and we watched a movie we&#39;ve been meaning to watch for a while, <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>, which is a movie based on a true story. Basically the main character is an expert con-man who&#39;s posed as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and conned his way to over $2.5 million, and an FBI agent is chasing him everywhere. Anyways, great movie, you got Tom Hanks; Leonardo DiCaprio; Christopher Walken; and a lot of guys, I liked it a lot. Jake (my friend) and I also ended up messing around with his guitars for a bit and went out for a walk. I feel like even though we did very normal friend stuff, I feel a lot closer to him. And I know you read this Jake, hahah so yeah I really appreciate us even just sitting and watching GMM like we did in probably 6th grade. I&#39;m probably not the only one like this but I think it&#39;s moments like those where you and your friend are just being stupid and making dumb jokes that are the kind of things you don&#39;t really forget. I&#39;m gonna be laughing about jokes Jake and I have made for a long time. From <em>heavysaber</em>, one of the first things we&#39;ve died laughing about, to <em>mm Tom Hanks</em>.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <strong>learned</strong> all that much today. But you know what? I don&#39;t care. I had a great day and had a lot of fun. I&#39;m starting new things and strengthening relationships and sometimes I think that&#39;s better than some kind of lesson I would&#39;ve <strong>learned</strong> on my own. I&#39;m gonna continue to <strong>listen</strong> for God <em>and</em> enjoy life, but now I&#39;m starting to think that between the two, there isn&#39;t much of a difference anyways.</p>
