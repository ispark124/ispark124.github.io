<p>Gosh, it&#39;s been a minute. It&#39;s been a long time and I can&#39;t say I know exactly what drew me back to this. I think it has to do with the excitement of Thanksgiving coming up and seeing my old high school friends again. There&#39;s so many things to talk about, and the question that everyone&#39;s going to be asking each other is, &quot;How has <strong>life</strong> been??&quot; which is such a loaded question. It seems like an infinite amount of time has passed since I&#39;ve seen everyone and I don&#39;t know where I wanna start. Also, to be honest, I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve taken the intentional time to sit and think about my <strong>life</strong>. I guess that brings me back to here—how has <strong>life</strong> been?  </p>
<p>Off the jump: I think I&#39;m exactly where I&#39;m supposed to be. I&#39;ve realized the Lord was working in my <strong>life</strong> very clearly, specifically in the past two years, to get me in a place where I am ready for my <strong>life</strong> right now and it kinda all started when I first made this site back in 2020. After my last post here, He&#39;s continued to show me how to rest, how to love His people, how to pursue Him, and it&#39;s all led me to the now. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve done this and I forget how I used to format all my blogging stuff, but it was never meant for other people so I&#39;m just gonna get into my <strong>life</strong> <strong>updates</strong> how I want to.  </p>
<p>1. REST<br>Literally thank God I&#39;ve started my journey with rest long before I got to school here. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve figured it out or that I&#39;m not still working on it, but gosh, finding rest in a place like Princeton has changed my <strong>life</strong>. The culture here is to grind and to work until your mental health suffers, and if you aren&#39;t working you should feel guilty about it. Chills. No but this is something I will be preaching about for the next four years of my <strong>life</strong> and will be the hill I die on. Rest is a war.<br>For me, rest has looked like so many different things. It&#39;s been shutting off work at a certain time, even if there&#39;s more I <em>could</em> be working on; it&#39;s been going on a run and listening to a podcast (yes it&#39;s restful); it&#39;s been prioritizing my time spent in the Word and with good community; it&#39;s been actively pursuing sleep. I cannot emphasize enough how this one aspect of balance completely changes everything.  </p>
<p>2. DANCE<br>Thinking about tangible <strong>updates</strong>, this was the first thing on my mind. I&#39;ve joined a dance team on campus and it&#39;s dope as heck. I don&#39;t even know where to start. <a href="https://www.bodyhypedance.com">BodyHype</a> is this insane contemporary and hip-hop team who&#39;s dancers actually blow me away (on and off the stage). I&#39;ve found some of the most incredible people through this team and I&#39;m in awe of the company that I get to be a part of. Dance is actually just a beautiful form of art and it&#39;s been so much fun to be challenged as a new dancer and to enter into this new world I&#39;ve never seen. I suck at remembering choreo and people here are ridiculously talented, but I&#39;m learning to just have fun with it and honestly I think the moment it becomes anything else is when I stop. But yeah, I never thought I&#39;d ever be on a dance team, yet here I am loving every bit of it. Love my hype fam.  </p>
<p>3. CLASSES<br>My goodness classes are hard. I mean, expected, but still. Ok it&#39;s manageable, but on a deeper level I think the hardest part for me is the fact that I don&#39;t know what I wanna do in the future. I continue to say I&#39;ll be a Mechanical Engineer but still have no clue what that looks like. When I&#39;m taking these classes it feels like I&#39;m running really fast with my eyes shut. I&#39;m on a track to becoming something that I don&#39;t know and who knows where that&#39;ll lead. I think I&#39;m just scared that I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;ll do in the future and I guess it comes down to, do I trust what God has for me? If that&#39;s the root of the problem (which I&#39;m realizing now it probably is), I&#39;m glad it&#39;s in His hands because it&#39;s definitely better than something I can plan.  </p>
<p>4. NOVA<br>Christian Union Nova is the Christian organization I&#39;ve been a part of here and it&#39;s honestly been keeping me so grounded here. There is such a loving community of believers in this space that continue to uplift me and challenge me in the ways I&#39;m <strong>living</strong>. I knew going into college this was what I would need and it continues to be a blessing to me the more I pour into it. Strong community has been prayer of mine for probably my whole <strong>life</strong> and to finally start to get plugged into places where people are seeking this same thing I am is so liberating.  </p>
<p>Ok so this is getting long and I&#39;m getting tired but that has been <strong>life</strong> pretty recently. I&#39;m quite rusty on the blogging and this was all over the place but it feels nice to be back writing again. This post was super over-arching and doesn&#39;t quite capture all my thoughts but that&#39;s alright. I think I&#39;m gonna try and make this a regular thing again—I kinda just wanna write about <strong>life</strong> more LOL. Who knows, we&#39;ll see. Be back soon.</p>
