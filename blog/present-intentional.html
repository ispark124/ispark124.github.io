<p>Today I was gonna write about something completely different but I felt compelled to write this after a conversation I had. This blog should be a place where I keep myself accountable and in check throughout my day and my week. So this is kinda where I'm at:<br><br>Recently I've been having really high highs and pretty low lows. I have practice in the morning and I'm always up (not so) bright and early at 7:30 every day. I go for my run and I feel amazing. I'm active and I'm doing something good for my body so I don't feel super anxious and restless the rest of the day, which happens when I don't run. Right after practice I've been seeing some friends or mowing lawns, something that's also really productive in my eyes. I still feel great, I'm definitely tired but I'm doing amazing. Throughout all of this I'm really trying to listen for the Lord. I wake up and I ask God, "What's on your heart today?" As I'm running I try to converse with Him or just be grateful I can even run and take in the beauty of the morning. I go on to do things that better myself, strengthening relationships or making some bank. By the time <em>all</em> of that is done, it's only 12:00. Then things start to go a little downhill.<br><br>By the time I'm home and I'm showered, I feel tired. Physically I'm worn out and don't want to do anything. The rest of the day moves deprecatingly slow. I waste my time on the couch or my bed. I waste my time on my phone or my laptop. I pick up a book every once in a while but I feel like I'm losing some kind of meaning. I'm not really living. It seems like my life happens all before 12 o'clock. <br><br>I've been telling myself that I want to live a better story but is that what this looks like? Sometimes I go on a long bike ride after dinner just to do something even if I'm so tired. Eventually I go to bed and wake up to live a great morning — not day because that's too long. I live for about 4 and a half hours a day.<br><br>As tough as this sounds, this is where I'm at. Don't get me wrong, I'm still learning a lot. I still hear from God after 12:00, it's not like I just sit in one spot staring at the wall. Like I said, I actually feel amazing a lot of the time but I feel like I can't do anything. I think I'm ok where I'm at right not but not ok with just being ok. So these are just things I wanna work on: living <strong>intentionally</strong>, I want to go about my day with a purpose even if I'm not necessarily doing anything I want it to be an <strong>intentional</strong> time; and listening for God, not just in the morning but throughout the whole day. <br><br>Today's post isn't some kind of lesson or amazing revelation I've had. Probably the opposite actually. I'm living in a mundane cycle and I wanna break out. Right now I'm living a filler episode, but I don't have an excuse since I'm the writer. I'm being absent to my own story. So this is just a reminder and a call to action for myself: be <strong>intentional</strong> in your life. Be <strong>present</strong> in your own story, Isaiah.</p>
