<p>Today I was gonna write about something completely different but I felt compelled to write this after a conversation I had. This blog should be a place where I keep myself accountable and in check throughout my day and my week. So this is kinda where I&#39;m at:  </p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve been having really high highs and pretty low lows. I have practice in the morning and I&#39;m always up (not so) bright and early at 7:30 every day. I go for my run and I feel amazing. I&#39;m active and I&#39;m doing something good for my body so I don&#39;t feel super anxious and restless the rest of the day, which happens when I don&#39;t run. Right after practice I&#39;ve been seeing some friends or mowing lawns, something that&#39;s also really productive in my eyes. I still feel great, I&#39;m definitely tired but I&#39;m doing amazing. Throughout all of this I&#39;m really trying to listen for the Lord. I wake up and I ask God, &quot;What&#39;s on your heart today?&quot; As I&#39;m running I try to converse with Him or just be grateful I can even run and take in the beauty of the morning. I go on to do things that better myself, strengthening relationships or making some bank. By the time <em>all</em> of that is done, it&#39;s only 12:00. Then things start to go a little downhill.  </p>
<p>By the time I&#39;m home and I&#39;m showered, I feel tired. Physically I&#39;m worn out and don&#39;t want to do anything. The rest of the day moves deprecatingly slow. I waste my time on the couch or my bed. I waste my time on my phone or my laptop. I pick up a book every once in a while but I feel like I&#39;m losing some kind of meaning. I&#39;m not really living. It seems like my life happens all before 12 o&#39;clock.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been telling myself that I want to live a better story but is that what this looks like? Sometimes I go on a long bike ride after dinner just to do something even if I&#39;m so tired. Eventually I go to bed and wake up to live a great morning — not day because that&#39;s too long. I live for about 4 and a half hours a day.  </p>
<p>As tough as this sounds, this is where I&#39;m at. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m still learning a lot. I still hear from God after 12:00, it&#39;s not like I just sit in one spot staring at the wall. Like I said, I actually feel amazing a lot of the time but I feel like I can&#39;t do anything. I think I&#39;m ok where I&#39;m at right not but not ok with just being ok. So these are just things I wanna work on: living <strong>intentionally</strong>, I want to go about my day with a purpose even if I&#39;m not necessarily doing anything I want it to be an <strong>intentional</strong> time; and listening for God, not just in the morning but throughout the whole day.  </p>
<p>Today&#39;s post isn&#39;t some kind of lesson or amazing revelation I&#39;ve had. Probably the opposite actually. I&#39;m living in a mundane cycle and I wanna break out. Right now I&#39;m living a filler episode, but I don&#39;t have an excuse since I&#39;m the writer. I&#39;m being absent to my own story. So this is just a reminder and a call to action for myself: be <strong>intentional</strong> in your life. Be <strong>present</strong> in your own story, Isaiah.</p>
