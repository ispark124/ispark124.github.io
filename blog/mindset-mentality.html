<p>I really have no idea what to write about so I'll just start with my day and then I'll probably get off track and find something to talk about.<br><br>Recently I've found out that I'm one of the cross country captains this year for my school so practices have been the first thing of the day for the past few weeks. I could not get up, I was so tired. My family and I have been watching this show called <em>Alone</em> on Netflix, and it's basically this group of people that get dropped off in the Arctic with 10 items of their choice and they survive by themselves as long as they can, last person to not tap out wins. Anyways, that's my excuse for staying up late and not sleeping. <br><br>So practice was pretty standard. We just did a normal run out a few miles and then turn around and run back. My teammate and I were feeling really terrible, normally Saturdays are our really long runs so we were still recovering from that (it's Monday today). But despite that -- oh! I got my topic for today.</p>

<p>I think that running is extremely hard, but not necessarily the physical aspect. If anyone runs for months obviously running 1 mile is gonna feel light and easy. Personally I believe running is mostly about your <strong>mental</strong> strength. Just now I was talking about my teammate and I and as we were running today. So I'll get back to that and how it sparked today's topic. We are now two weeks into our season and both of us have been doing relatively the same amounts of running. I took the first half of the first week off but other than that we've been running the same. Saturday was a good show of that, both of us doing 6 miles for the first time in months and finishing together. But today something was different. Both of us felt terrible on our run but despite that I still managed to end up ahead of him and also do an extra mile. Now that's not to say that he's a bad runner or that I'm much better. He's an amazing runner and we've both been keeping up with each other for a while, but today was different. I believe I pushed myself harder <strong>mentally</strong> that allowed me to go ahead and finish stronger. <br><br>When racing season comes around everyone is in their peak physical condition and I really believe that by that point it's all about <strong>mentality</strong>. Ok, I know there's natural skill and genetics and training and diets and all of that, but when two people are head to head in the last 400 meters of a race, the person who wants it more is going to win. Every. Single. Time. Something that my coach has said that's stuck with me for a very long time is, "Everyone's just as tired as you are, everyone's running the same race as you." In cross country and track, everyone in your event is running the same exact course, the same exact distance, the same exact hills that you are, the conditions are always the same. <br><br>When it comes to working at something or trying something new, I think the biggest obstacle you will face is your own <strong>mind</strong>. Overcoming the idea that, "I can't." or "It's too hard." is when you finally break the threshold that makes really good at anything. There <em>always</em> comes a point when you are picking up a new skill, you start to get decent maybe even good so you want to learn the advanced stuff. That is when you have the largest mountain to face and when most people quit what they do. At that point all you can do is tell yourself — force yourself — to keep at it. <br><br>Oh I got an amazing connection, there was a contestant in that show I was talking about, <em>Alone</em>. This contestant had everything going for him: a great shelter, he was away from the freezing cold, but most importantly he had food stored for the next week and a half. He was living his best life, there were other contestants not eating for over a week and barely finding food. He was comfortable, but bored and unsatisfied. He questioned himself, "Is this worth it?" He was missing his daughter's birthday to be on this show, his family was still living their lives while he was there. He couldn't take it and tapped out. There were so many other people who would have killed to be where he was but in the end, he couldn't take it. <strong>Mentality</strong>, man. <br><br>Your <strong>mentality</strong> and <strong>mindset</strong> about anything is so important. Everything stems from how bad you wants something and then from there how hard will you work to get it. And that's as insightful as I'm gonna be today. <br><br>I'm definitely gonna need to push myself to write every day and I think it's funny that this is the first thing that I'm writing about. I recently heard this and I thought it was funny, "Writer's block doesn't exist, you're just too lazy to write." Actually, that hurts more than it makes me laugh HAHA! But there is some truth to that, it's like running. Even if I really don't want to run that day, I still do. This is that exercise that I was talking about, gotta get my spirit in shape. <br><br>Anyways, sorry this post was all over the place, there'll be a lot more of that so this sorry  will just cover all of the times where I'm everywhere. I think this is a good start to what I hope will be a good journey. Writing everyday for — did I say 2 weeks? This'll be fun, I just gotta have a gOoD <strong>mENtAliTy</strong> hahhah. </p>
