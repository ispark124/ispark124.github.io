<p>I can&#39;t say I know what I&#39;m gonna write about right now, but I do feel like there is something to be written about. Hey, maybe that&#39;s always the case, I don&#39;t know. Regardless, excuse the messy post but this is what it is.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s a weird feeling I have right now. It&#39;s a mix of nostalgia, love for <strong>home</strong>, loving my friends and also missing my <em>new</em> <strong>home</strong>, being grateful for my new friends, and <strong>growing</strong> past this cycle I&#39;m in. There&#39;s a lot to unpack there. First of all, I&#39;m <strong>home</strong> and I know that for a fact. I know that because I see my family in my house, I drive my car down the streets of my town, I hang out with my friends in our go-to spots. I&#39;m <strong>home</strong>. It seems very obvious and it doesn&#39;t feel like that statement needs to be made yet here I am. I guess I&#39;m trying to make sure in my mind I really am <strong>home</strong>. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m here and all of this feels familiar, but at the same time it&#39;s not the same as it used to be. It&#39;s just different.  </p>
<p>For me, familiar right now feels like waking up in my dorm and cracking open the blinds because I wanna see the sun, it&#39;s eating that same Domino&#39;s pizza every Thursday night during bible study, it&#39;s going down to the Butler Basement and finding the people I love seeing. But at the same time, I don&#39;t think being familiar necessarily makes it a <strong>home</strong>. (Think someday I&#39;ll have nostalgia over those things?) It&#39;s just a different.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve been hanging out with my old high school friends a lot these days and gosh I missed them so much. It&#39;s hard to describe, but it feels good to talk and laugh about things I haven&#39;t even thought about in months. There&#39;s this level of freedom I haven&#39;t felt with college friends. I think it&#39;s because I&#39;ve made a life with these people and it&#39;s a life that college has only gotten to see the result of. My hometown friends and I have gotten to know each other in the most formative years of our lives and no one really replaces that. But the thing is, now that I am back it kind of feels like I&#39;m frozen in time. Of course we&#39;ve changed and <strong>grown</strong> but we fall back into our same roles and dynamics as a group and I also don&#39;t know how I feel about that. It&#39;s just different.  </p>
<p>Reading all of that over, it doesn&#39;t really make sense but what I&#39;m trying to say is <strong>home</strong> doesn&#39;t feel like <strong>home</strong>. But college also doesn&#39;t feel like it either. So then what&#39;s changed?  </p>
<p>I think I&#39;m starting to realize something—I&#39;m <strong>growing</strong> up. Gasp. But this realization really does explain a lot of things. As nice as it feels to be back, I can&#39;t ever truly be back because I&#39;m simply a different person than I was before. I&#39;m realizing now the reason I feel upset about not feeling the same as I did a few months ago is because I&#39;m forcing myself to be who I was a few months ago, and that&#39;s just not me anymore. Ultimately, I&#39;m doing all the things I used to and wanting the same results I got then. It all feels like wearing clothes that I&#39;ve <strong>grown</strong> out of. And that makes me upset. I love those clothes.  </p>
<p>Ok, I change my mind. Clothes is a bad analogy because people throw out their old clothes and that makes me big upset because that&#39;s not what I want. New analogy: a plant that has outgrown the pot it&#39;s currently in. That&#39;s so fire. Check it, the plant needed the smaller pot to receive its nutrients, water, and whatever else plants need. But as it <strong>grows</strong> and gets too big, it takes the lessons it&#39;s learned, the friendships, the love of the past season into its next pot. It doesn&#39;t leave them but just carries them over into a new space where there is a greater capacity for <strong>growth</strong>. That is the difference. <strong>Growing</strong> up is realizing I have different wants and different needs than I did before, and that&#39;s ok. I can still take what I learned and bring the people I love into wherever I&#39;m going next. It&#39;ll just look different. Which is good because I am different.  </p>
<p>So this is getting long and was all over the place but at least I feel better. It&#39;s good to know there seems to be a reason for this tension I&#39;m feeling. Honestly, I&#39;m just glad I can tackle this part of my life with intentionality. I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what&#39;s different because my heart just craves different things. Maybe that&#39;s the whole thing of <strong>growing</strong> up, it&#39;s not necessarily that life changes a crazy amount but it&#39;s your heart that <strong>grows</strong> and you just have to follow it. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m looking forward to where it&#39;s leading me.</p>
