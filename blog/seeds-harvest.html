<p>As I was sitting and reflecting last night, I kept getting this reoccurring theme of a <strong>harvest</strong>—a season of plenty, of abundance, of favor. I can't even say I know why because, right now, I'm pretty sure I don't feel crazy abundant. I know I literally just wrote another post about <a href="https://isaiahscorner.wordpress.com/2022/11/19/time-abundance/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time &amp; abundance</a> and feeling like I was living out of this great overflow, but that's just how life goes! It ebbs and flows and even within the span of a couple weeks life changes. And that's ok. I'm still rooted.<br><br>The thing about a <strong>harvest</strong> is that it takes a lot of unseen and disciplined work. I'm no farmer but I doubt that they remember every single day they went out to tend to their field, water their crops, or feed their cattle. But they know it got done by the fact that everything is still alive and I feel like discipline and faith are a little like that. Do I remember every single verse I've been reading throughout the day? Every life-giving conversation? Of course not, but I do know <strong>seeds</strong> are being planted that I will see the fruit of later. It's a lifestyle to cultivate and not just a one-time purchase of fruit. That was good.<br><br>The verse of the day yesterday really struck me as I continued to read the chapter. Psalm 126:6 says,</p>

<p>Life sucks sometimes. It makes me cry. I look down and all I have are freaking <strong>seeds</strong>. How is that supposed to help me now? I'm tired of it. But then I'm reminded of the <strong>harvest</strong>. I think it's a beautiful thing that I, as someone who's messed up a lot, who's hurt a lot of people, can still continue to sow what the Lord has given me and reap the benefits. I'm shown grace and mercy not to take advantage of it, but to change myself and try to be better, to plant better <strong>seeds</strong>. There are incredible things that I get to experience and take part in because of the weeping and planting of <strong>seeds</strong> I did in a previous season. Now, faced with new struggles and new circumstances, there are things I'm only just learning to sow and I know it's going to take time. For those that really know me, help keep me accountable. The Lord knows I need it. I think Jesus put it beautifully when he said,</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters <strong>seed</strong> on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the <strong>seed</strong> sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the <strong>harvest</strong> has come."<br>Mark 4:26-28</p>

<p>So as much work and toil I put in, there is a greater Kingdom work happening that I don't have control over. I get to put my trust in the Lord's work and know that it is good. I think it's pretty amazing that as I get older I'm learning how to do both sowing and reaping; I can be carrying the <strong>harvest</strong> from previous seasons while planting the <strong>seeds</strong> for the next. It's a growing time to be in.</p>
