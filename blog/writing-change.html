<p><strong>Writing</strong> is hard sometimes. Right now I feel inspired to do more: I want to <strong>write</strong> more, I want to listen more. But if I&#39;m being honest I have no idea what to <strong>write</strong> about.</p>
<p>I feel like there&#39;s been a trend that&#39;s been going on with my blog posts and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something I want to continue. I started this blog as a place for me to share my thoughts, the things I&#39;m learning, or just creative things that come to me. But what it&#39;s turned into is a place where I feel as though I have to learn a whole life lesson. Like some children&#39;s book where I face a problem and then face some conflict-resolution and then by the end I learn how to be a better person. It&#39;s exhausting. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love <strong>writing</strong>, but now it&#39;s become something that has pressure to it which was <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong> the intended purpose. It was actually supposed to be the exact opposite of that. A place for me to speak not for the approval of others.</p>
<p>As real and transparent as I have been in my posts, it still feels as though I&#39;m showing myself only when I overcome something or learn some great, godly wisdom. I also feel that&#39;s hindering my ability to write more often. It&#39;s become a habit to only come to write to share my victories or my lessons. And I want that to change ASAP.</p>
<p>The past few weeks I&#39;ve been running again to get back in shape for my cross country season and when I was on a run a while ago I felt like God was saying to me, &quot;Just as you&#39;re training your body every day, your spirit&#39;s gotta do the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Trust God to come through and tell me my spirit&#39;s out of shape HAHA! But I really do wanna take what He said to heart. So now, for the next 2 weeks I want to challenge myself to <strong>write</strong> every single day on here. Try to do something new to listen for Him, and just <strong>write</strong> every day. I know the posts will get tedious and also many will probably suck, but honestly I think that&#39;s a good thing. I want to break out of my pattern of following the same routine every post.</p>
<p>I had an <em>amazing</em> conversation yesterday and a phrase that really stuck out to me was, &quot;this is a foundation-building season.&quot; Yo CMON, tell me that isn&#39;t heat! Nasty. I think God&#39;s gonna do a lot of things this coming season and it&#39;s gonna <strong>change</strong> very fast, so a strong foundation&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s gonna keep me from falling. This is all part of that. So as I go into this challenge I&#39;m looking forward to all that God&#39;s gonna speak to me about, all the barriers He&#39;s gonna break, all the <strong>change</strong> He&#39;s gonna bring. I&#39;m excited for this.</p>
<p>Guess I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.</p>
