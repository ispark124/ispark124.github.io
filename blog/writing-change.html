<p><strong>Writing</strong> is hard sometimes. Right now I feel inspired to do more: I want to <strong>write</strong> more, I want to listen more. But if I’m being honest I have no idea what to <strong>write</strong> about. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel like there’s been a trend that’s been going on with my blog posts and I don’t know if that’s something I want to continue. I started this blog as a place for me to share my thoughts, the things I’m learning, or just creative things that come to me. But what it’s turned into is a place where I feel as though I have to learn a whole life lesson. Like some children’s book where I face a problem and then face some conflict-resolution and then by the end I learn how to be a better person. It’s exhausting. Don’t get me wrong, I love <strong>writing</strong>, but now it’s become something that has pressure to it which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>NEVER</em></strong></span> the intended purpose. It was actually supposed to be the exact opposite of that. A place for me to speak not for the approval of others. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As real and transparent as I have been in my posts, it still feels as though I’m showing myself only when I overcome something or learn some great, godly wisdom. I also feel that’s hindering my ability to write more often. It’s become a habit to only come to write to share my victories or my lessons. And I want that to change ASAP. </p>

<p>The past few weeks I’ve been running again to get back in shape for my cross country season and when I was on a run a while ago I felt like God was saying to me, “Just as you’re training your body every day, your spirit’s gotta do the same.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trust God to come through and tell me my spirit’s out of shape HAHA! But I really do wanna take what He said to heart. So now, for the next 2 weeks I want to challenge myself to <strong>write</strong> every single day on here. Try to do something new to listen for Him, and just <strong>write</strong> every day. I know the posts will get tedious and also many will probably suck, but honestly I think that’s a good thing. I want to break out of my pattern of following the same routine every post. </p>

<p>I had an <em>amazing</em> conversation yesterday and a phrase that really stuck out to me was, “this is a foundation-building season.” Yo CMON, tell me that isn’t heat! Nasty. I think God’s gonna do a lot of things this coming season and it’s gonna <strong>change</strong> very fast, so a strong foundation’s the only thing that’s gonna keep me from falling. This is all part of that. So as I go into this challenge I’m looking forward to all that God’s gonna speak to me about, all the barriers He’s gonna break, all the <strong>change</strong> He’s gonna bring. I’m excited for this.</p>
