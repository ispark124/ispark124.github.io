<p>Today&#39;s post is gonna come super easily to me, I feel like I&#39;ve talked about this a lot over the last two days to people and it&#39;s something I really wanna share.  </p>
<p>Almost two months ago exactly I started a TikTok. If I&#39;m being honest I was one of the people that would refuse to get TikTok and I would hate to think of myself as a person who made videos on TikTok and yet there I was. I thought it would be a good time to start making videos, I wanted my content to be somewhat similar to what I&#39;m doing here on my blog. I wanted it to just be another outlet for me to express myself, I made stuff I thought was funny or things that popped into my head. I feel like these kinds of jokes or skits have always been in my head but now TikTok was kinda just a platform to put it on. Similar to this blog, I wasn&#39;t doing it to get views or <strong>follows</strong>, but it was just a place for me to be myself and I even told my mentor I wanted it to be a space for me to practice self control in a lot of ways.  </p>
<p>Recently, especially over the past month, I&#39;ve been picking up a <strong>following</strong> and even had a couple videos getting hundreds of thousands of views. Naturally I am someone that is fueled by other people: I like knowing that people like me, I am someone that seeks other people&#39;s approval, and not that I <em>need</em> to be liked by everyone but I really really want to be hahah! So when I started getting these views and getting these <strong>likes</strong> and getting these <strong>follows</strong>, my mentality started to change. If I&#39;m being completely honest I think I knew this was gonna happen, subconsciously I wanted it all along. I wanted the fame, I wanted the recognition, so as soon as I got a taste I wanted more. I started posting every day hoping to gain more <strong>followers</strong> and I would be upset and disappointed if a video I made that day wasn&#39;t doing as well as others. I would make sure to post at the right times, use the right hashtags, make &quot;funnier&quot; content. Basically I was trying to make content that <em>other</em> people would enjoy and it consumed me in the process. I make it sound like a long time ago but really this was a month ago all the way up to just earlier this week. I became obsessed.  </p>
<p>It was just yesterday that I&#39;ve been opening my eyes to what&#39;s been going on. I was praying after a great conversation I had and I was wondering why I had so much going for me and yet something felt like I was being held back. As I prayed and asked God for Him to reveal more for me, I felt the Lord saying, &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s time for you to get off TikTok.&quot; Immediately like a switch went off I started to see what I&#39;ve become. Not just the amount of time and effort that I would put into videos that I would hope would get me famous was a lot but even just time spent looking through videos and other people&#39;s content has been so much.  </p>
<p>I was reading a book today and came across this quote that I know God placed in there to kick me right in the chest. It said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I used to be afraid of failing at something that really mattered to me, but now I&#39;m more afraid of succeeding at things that don&#39;t matter.&quot; -Bob Goff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s filthy. That got me. He hit me with that one-two. The way that just applies to my life right now is insane. These views, these <strong>follows</strong>, these <strong>likes</strong>, do they even matter? For me, it was never supposed to. But I turned it into my idol. Sure it&#39;s cool that some I&#39;m getting thousands of <strong>likes</strong>, sure it&#39;s cool that famous people are <strong>following</strong> me, but I hate how that has become my motivator. I hate how there is no end goal but to just get more. I&#39;m willing to succeed at all this that doesn&#39;t matter while slowly losing in my family relationships, losing in my hobbies, losing in the things that matter. I&#39;m not becoming a better person because of these TikToks or because of how many <strong>followers</strong> or <strong>likes</strong> I have. That&#39;s why I&#39;m listening to the Lord and quitting TikTok.  </p>
<p>I am not defined by what other people think of me. I know that this concept will be a lifelong struggle for me simply because of my personality, but it&#39;s something I have to learn and relearn whenever it comes up. As I press the delete button on my account and on the app on my phone I feel an overwhelming amount of freedom. Although I have mixed feelings about deleting everything, I know it&#39;s just a result of me resisting my fleshly desires. I pray that God can now utilize this time that I have for His glory.  </p>
<p>Even though I only talked about the negatives of making videos on TikTok, I&#39;ve learned and grown so much from this time. I now know how easy it is to get famous if you&#39;re good looking and lean into that HAHA! Not that I did that, the one video that I slightly did that I deleted (I still had some sense of decency and modesty lol). But seriously I&#39;ve been able to connect with so many people that I otherwise never would have been able to meet. Even though this wasn&#39;t a necessarily God-filled time, I&#39;ve still been able to show people Christ&#39;s love and lead them to places like this blog or to Christian music. I&#39;ve met some awesome people through all of this and it has been really fun. I&#39;m really grateful for this time and opportunity to learn so much and meet so many good people, also revealing a comedic and creative side to me that hasn&#39;t showed up to me the way it has on TikTok.  </p>
<p>I pray for all the people I&#39;ve met and creators I&#39;ve been able to communicate with. It&#39;s been a great time.</p>
