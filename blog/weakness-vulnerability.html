<p>I feel like there&#39;s a lot on my mind as of late but I don&#39;t really know what to say. I think I&#39;ll start with an apology. This blog was started a while ago to share my journey through life in an open and transparent way—to process my thoughts in a very public domain. To be honest, I feel like I haven&#39;t done particularly well in being transparent about my own shortcomings. In general, I think the world is so afraid to be <strong>vulnerable</strong> and any sign of it is a sign of <strong>weakness</strong>. This space was supposed to be going against this worldly idea of invincibility but I feel like I&#39;ve just been adding to it. So I&#39;m sorry.  </p>
<p>The thing is, without <strong>vulnerability</strong> there can never be true healing or growth. Of course I know this in my head but to truly believe it and live it out is another thing completely. This blog has been great for me to show how I&#39;ve been learning new truths about God and, through those truths, myself, or to show a revelation about the questions I&#39;ve been having. But I&#39;m afraid that I can see how this formula is all that this blog has been becoming. I fear that this whole operation is just becoming another highlight reel of my life and almost boasting about the insights I&#39;ve been having into life or how strong of a person I am. Honestly, I&#39;ve been scared that if I&#39;m <strong>vulnerable</strong> people would lose their trust in me or I&#39;d be seen as <strong>weak</strong> or I&#39;d be hurt. But now, I want to trust that what I&#39;m saying can be used regardless of my status with other people. Ultimately, I will boast all the more gladly about my <strong>weakness</strong> so that His power may rest on me.  </p>
<p>Now we&#39;re getting into it LOL.  </p>
<p>I think, overall, I feel like a fraud. Maybe I&#39;ve just forgotten a lot of the lessons I&#39;ve learned before or maybe I&#39;m being tested in ways that I&#39;ve definitely failed before. Regardless, I&#39;m tired of trying to be strong enough or smart enough or wise enough; I can&#39;t do it and it&#39;s exhausting. I want to stop pretending like I have all the answers or like I know best. These days, I&#39;ve kinda been living life on autopilot and trusting my foundations to get me through each day. I haven&#39;t really been living my life out of overflow, and it&#39;s felt like I&#39;ve been living life off of the fruits of this last season. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being poured into or being given life but it feels like I&#39;m trying to give people something I don&#39;t have. I feel inadequate and <strong>weak</strong> and small and that kinda sucks.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m usually known for being stable and dependable, but I&#39;m tired. I feel like I want to be selfish and do things because I want to. I&#39;m tired of waiting for better things to come when I can have fun, unsustainable things right now. I want to be reckless and do things I know will lead to hurt and pain. I want to lose myself. I&#39;m losing myself.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve lost my Source.</p>
<p>I&#39;m tired because I&#39;m the one who&#39;s been trying to be big enough, to be strong enough. There&#39;s a God who already is all of that for me so I don&#39;t have to be. I&#39;ve been telling some of my friends about this God who is love and peace and joy, but I&#39;m highkey forgetting who He says He is too. I&#39;m forgetting how bad He wants relationship with me and to be so much more than a morality that I blindly follow. I&#39;m forgetting the history that we have, of Him pulling me out of dark places and saving my life. I&#39;m forgetting His love for me.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t really know how to end this with a neat little bow like I&#39;ve usually done. It&#39;s been a week. But, if this past week has shown me anything, it&#39;s that I&#39;m still a <strong>weak</strong> person. I am not strong. I am not able. But the thing is, that&#39;s okay. That&#39;s okay because I don&#39;t have to be. I still need reminding every single day about the God who is strong enough to hold me and all of my inadequacy and still say that He loves me. I think we all need that reminder sometimes. Thanks for allowing me to be <strong>vulnerable</strong>.</p>
