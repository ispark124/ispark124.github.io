<p>Today I was really reluctant to be pulled aside to start writing this. The thing about today was that I did absolutely nothing, but at the same time learned and experienced so much.  </p>
<p>Today I&#39;ve been rediscovering what it&#39;s like to fall in love with <strong>reading</strong>. Getting completely immersed in a story to not want to put it down. It&#39;s been a goal of mine this summer to <strong>read</strong> a lot more and I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ve been doing just that. For the past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been <strong>reading</strong> some great <strong>books</strong>: <em>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years</em> by Donald Miller and <em>Love Does</em> by Bob Goff, both <strong>books</strong> that I highly, highly recommend. After practice and some breakfast, without anything better to do, I picked up <em>Ready Player One</em> by Ernest Cline.  </p>
<p><em>Ready Player One</em> is a movie that I&#39;ve seen a couple times and has been recommended to me a lot. I&#39;m am so glad that I decided to <strong>read</strong> it in the first place. Although the story concept is similar, the <strong>book</strong> is almost completely different from the movie, something that I was extremely happy about. Knowing how good the movie and its story was, I&#39;m glad that the actual story of the <strong>book</strong> is something that I can enjoy as something new and in my opinion even better. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily about the <strong>book</strong> itself that I&#39;m enjoying, although it is an <em>amazing</em> <strong>book</strong>. I love the idea of being able to stare at words on a page and imagine intricate scenes in my head, watch as these characters learn and grow, and learn so much from sitting on my own couch.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s been a very, very long time since I&#39;ve spent hours and hours <strong>reading</strong> a <strong>book</strong> in a day. I&#39;ve always loved <strong>reading</strong> but have fallen out of it from middle school when I felt like I couldn&#39;t make time or find a <strong>book</strong> enjoyable enough. I started this <strong>book</strong> today and have gone through over 500 pages and probably wouldn&#39;t have stopped until I finished except I looked at the time and realized I haven&#39;t written today. There&#39;s so much that I could write about the lessons that are slipped into <em>Ready Player One</em> and the things that I&#39;m learning, but what I want to take away is importance and my love for <strong>reading</strong> again.</p>
<p>There&#39;s really isn&#39;t much to this post which I&#39;m ok with. I&#39;m just really thankful that I&#39;m being thrown way back to 5th grade where you would find me curled up in a chair, <strong>reading</strong> for hours. So as terrible quality as this blog was, I don&#39;t really care. I&#39;m gonna get back to my <strong>book</strong> now.</p>
