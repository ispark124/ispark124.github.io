<p>Today I was really reluctant to be pulled aside to start writing this. The thing about today was that I did absolutely nothing, but at the same time learned and experienced so much.<br><br>Today I've been rediscovering what it's like to fall in love with <strong>reading</strong>. Getting completely immersed in a story to not want to put it down. It's been a goal of mine this summer to <strong>read</strong> a lot more and I'm glad that I've been doing just that. For the past couple of weeks I've been <strong>reading</strong> some great <strong>books</strong>: <em>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years</em> by Donald Miller and <em>Love Does </em>by Bob Goff, both <strong>books</strong> that I highly, highly recommend. After practice and some breakfast, without anything better to do, I picked up <em>Ready Player One </em>by Ernest Cline. <br><br><em>Ready Player One</em> is a movie that I've seen a couple times and has been recommended to me a lot. I'm am so glad that I decided to <strong>read</strong> it in the first place. Although the story concept is similar, the <strong>book</strong> is almost completely different from the movie, something that I was extremely happy about. Knowing how good the movie and its story was, I'm glad that the actual story of the <strong>book</strong> is something that I can enjoy as something new and in my opinion even better. But I don't think it's necessarily about the <strong>book</strong> itself that I'm enjoying, although it is an <em>amazing</em> <strong>book</strong>. I love the idea of being able to stare at words on a page and imagine intricate scenes in my head, watch as these characters learn and grow, and learn so much from sitting on my own couch. <br><br>It's been a very, very long time since I've spent hours and hours <strong>reading</strong> a <strong>book</strong> in a day. I've always loved <strong>reading</strong> but have fallen out of it from middle school when I felt like I couldn't make time or find a <strong>book</strong> enjoyable enough. I started this <strong>book</strong> today and have gone through over 500 pages and probably wouldn't have stopped until I finished except I looked at the time and realized I haven't written today. There's so much that I could write about the lessons that are slipped into <em>Ready Player One</em> and the things that I'm learning, but what I want to take away is importance and my love for <strong>reading</strong> again. </p>

<p>There's really isn't much to this post which I'm ok with. I'm just really thankful that I'm being thrown way back to 5th grade where you would find me curled up in a chair, <strong>reading</strong> for hours. So as terrible quality as this blog was, I don't really care. I'm gonna get back to my <strong>book</strong> now.</p>
